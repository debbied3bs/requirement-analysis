# ğŸ§© Requirement Analysis in Software Development

Welcome to my **Requirement Analysis** repository!

This repository explores the first and most crucial phase of the **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** â€” requirement analysis.  
Itâ€™s all about understanding **what the software should do**, **who will use it**, and **what goals it needs to achieve** before any code is written.  

The purpose of this repo is to:
- Learn the key concepts behind requirement gathering and analysis.  
- Document different types of requirements (functional and non-functional).  
- Practice analyzing real-world software requirements.  

> This project is part of my journey to understand the foundations of software engineering and how clear requirements lead to better, more user-focused solutions. ğŸš€
